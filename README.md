## Bacon Workshop

This repo is a collection of exercises and examples to supplement a talk for SXSW 2016 on functional Javascript and Functional Reactive Programming with the Baconjs framework.

In order to get things working:

1. `npm install` for dependencies
2. run each example or exercise with node path/to/file
3. feel free to experiment with pieces to figure out how they work
